# LAST MAN STANDING
  ### The only video ad it was unable to skip (for me), is this one. It appears after an unskippable ad once in a blue moon.
  While testing the extension, It appeared that depending on which 'seed' you land on, you might get this kind of ad after an unskippable ad once every 10-15 ads, or not get it at all.
  
  And by 'seed' I mean, 1 page refresh = different seed. It's weird how I get either unskippable ads every 5 videos, or only skippable ads for like 30 videos, but that might just be me.

I probably skipped through 500-600 ads today. ðŸ¤¡ Enjoy the extension.
